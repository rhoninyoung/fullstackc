Just for fun and practice(C语言复健✗(真C✓))

This project emerged from a deep curiosity about compilers and programming language design, particularly sparked by an interest in domain-specific languages (DSLs). It represents an attempt to experiment with unconventional approaches to foundational C programming — true understanding, I believe, only crystallizes through the process of building systems from scratch.

Future directions may include:

### TODOLIST
- [ ] Enhancing extensibility
- [ ] Porting the frontend to WebAssembly
Strengthening backend robustness(adopting common networking patterns:
- [ ] concurrency/connection
- [ ] pooling/caching/load balancing
- [ ] improved logging/error handling
- [ ] security hardening)

Personal musings (feel free to skip):
The fragmentation of computing seems inevitable as specialized domains proliferate. Just as DSLs complement general-purpose languages, we might see domain-specific processing units (DSPUs) evolve alongside heterogeneous processors (XPUs). Even the von Neumann architecture, memory-centric by design, will likely transform as computing permeates new frontiers.

Does this render general-purpose processors and languages obsolete? I believe they'll persist in equilibrium(at least 20%/80%) — most users won't need extreme specialization. As for programming languages, their true value and adoption rationale  only reveals itself through prolonged, deep engagement(Rust excepted).
